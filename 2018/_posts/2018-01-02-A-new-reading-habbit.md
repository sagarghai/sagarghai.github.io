**Alrighty!**

I just wanted to put it out in the open, for social pressure drives me in the right direction. I chose my habit for the year to be reading. So the first thing I did was that I put it out in the open for everybody to critique. Now I know, you are your own best critic, but you know someone else's perspective matters.

This year I have decided to read atleast 15 books, which is slightly more than a book a month, less for a reader but significantly more than my previous year's number which was 4, so that effectively makes a 400% growth nearly :P.

To achive this, I start planning the books I will be reading in the next three months and I order the books I would be reading two months hence already. This gives me a sense of future planning for your own self. I would slowly be pushing this forward to an year and also increase the no. of books I read.

Finally to stem the habit in, I have decided to read atleast 5 pages every night even if I doze off reading. They say it helps to retain things, when you read them just before sleeping. Let's see how this turns out to be.
