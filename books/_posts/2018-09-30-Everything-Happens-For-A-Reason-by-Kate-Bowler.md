Kate bowler pens down an amazing story of how she struggled through her life of illnesses with cancer being her final frontier. The book is an amazing amalgamation of the prosperity gospel and the reality of life.

"I have the magic cancer!, I have the magic cancer!" - exclaiming for the tiny rays of hope that brought cheer into the life a young mom who wanted to survive for her child. I was deeply entrenched in the book for its sheer quality of calm and composed writing and a hint of comedy in the midst of disaster.
