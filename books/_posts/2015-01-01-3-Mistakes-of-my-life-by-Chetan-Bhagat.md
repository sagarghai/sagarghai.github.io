title: "3 mistakes of my life by Chetan Bhagat"

When I started reading, I was thrown towards Chetan Bhagat. In all his bad reviews, I have always found that even the reviewers do not have a sense of uniqueness. I see this man doing something that he doesn't even know perfectly but hustling and selling millions of copies of each of his books. Now that is a lesson for all you people who think it is just a repetition. Even bollywood is doing the same. Making what sells.
