What do you do when you are born illegal? You wear it as an armor because everybody else will scourge to kill you. This is what really happened with Noah, who was born as an illegal human being in South Africa's apartheid regime. The book is more about how his mother, the real hero of the book, manages to raise a child in all her willingness to go against the society.

The final few pages, make you wonder what on earth is this woman. Is she a rebel? Is she the embodiment of fearlessness? For me she changed how the society should be looked at when making life decisions and the answer is just like they do not exist.
