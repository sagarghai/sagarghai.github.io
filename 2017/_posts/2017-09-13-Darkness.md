description: I Do not Fear
---

When the incumbent reality of life draws near,
it makes me reach out for a tear,
it tells you that you are infinite,
yet nowhere near.

But I do not fear.

Heroes are born everyday
but none with a mission so clear.
They tell you to stick around,
let others talk, to them you are not bound,
yet it makes you tremble,
what if what they think is real.

I do not fear.

You are born for something special they said,
Do not fear, do not whine,
there is hope even in the last try.
But when it ends, you will cry.
Winner or looser, your feelings shall surely die.

Yet, I will never fear.
For I know someday, I’ll be a winner,
to my dreams that are dear.

— From the unused part of an engineers brain!
