description: I Do not Fear
---

When the incumbent reality of life draws near,<br/>
it makes me reach out for a tear,<br/>
it tells you that you are infinite,<br/>
yet nowhere near.<br/>

But I do not fear.

Heroes are born everyday<br/>
but none with a mission so clear.<br/>
They tell you to stick around,<br/>
let others talk, to them you are not bound,<br/>
yet it makes you tremble,<br/>
what if what they think is real.<br/>

I do not fear.

You are born for something special they said,<br/>
Do not fear, do not whine,<br/>
there is hope even in the last try.<br/>
But when it ends, you will cry.<br/>
Winner or looser, your feelings shall surely die.<br/>

Yet, I will never fear.<br/>
For I know someday, I’ll be a winner,<br/>
to my dreams that are dear.<br/>
