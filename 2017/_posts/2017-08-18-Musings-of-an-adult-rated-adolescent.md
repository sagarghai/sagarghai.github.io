*   Is the truth always right, for it hurts more often,
    But a lie will eventually kill the good in you,
    So do you lie or be a righteous culprit,
    Or do you right every wrong and be killed yourself.

*   Why do humans kill themselves?
    Does the society not let them be?
    Or is it their shattered brain?
    Or is it the society that shattered them long ago,
    to which their heart gave up!

*   When a man dies, the soul is put into another being,
    when a friend dies, the soul stays with us,
    when someone closer dies, the soul stays with you,
    but when you die, the soul is gone forever.

*   Isn’t money the essential ingredient of life,
    or is it love and friendship.
    No single man ever lived happily with just their money,
    And yet the poor is the most miserable.

*   Knowledge is power and yet we are ruled by barely educated,
    governed by the corrupt yet the most educated,
    laughed at by the least expected,
    Loved by the most anticipated.

— From the unused part of an engineers brain!
