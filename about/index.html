           I am an MBA participant at IIM Indore. I am a technopreneur i.e a tech guy with an entrepreneurial drive with a knack for problem solving.

           <br/>

           I worked as a Software Engineer  with Nucleus Software Exports Limited, a B2B product company working to solve the problem of digital lending. I worked to improve the productâ€™s ability to be used by other developers in partner organizations. Alongside I was also  tasked to bring AI capabilities into the product which was my own personal initiative.

           I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi in 2017 with a Minor in Management. I am an AI enthusiast and I believe that AI is going to bring a lot of change to our society in the years to come.
