           I am a Software Engineer working with Nucleus Software Exports Limited, a B2B product company working to solve the problem of digital lending. I am currently improving the productâ€™s ability to be used by other developers in partner organizations. Alongside I have also been tasked to bring AI capabilities into the product which is my own personal initiative.

           I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi in 2017 with a Minor in Management. I am an AI enthusiast and I believe that AI is going to bring a lot of change to our society in the years to come.
